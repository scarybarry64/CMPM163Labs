How: 
(From left to right) The first cube is made using shaders. I simply copied the code provided in the lab for making the other shader cube, though I made a separate fragment shader per the instructions. I then changed the color to lime, and had it rotate on the z-axis. The second cube is made using Three.js materials. It's the first cube made per the instructions. It has a grey phong material, with some specular and shininess. The lighting adds a greenish tint to the cube too. The third cube (my favorite) is also made using Three.js materials. For this, I used a toon material and colored it orange. I tweaked its specular, shininess, transparancy, and opacity to give it a shiny see-through look. The lighting makes it pulse magenta once it hits a certain angle as it rotates in the negative x direction. Lastly is the second cube mader per the instructions. It uses shaders, mixing colors to achieve a cyan sheen with hints of blue on its lower corners.
